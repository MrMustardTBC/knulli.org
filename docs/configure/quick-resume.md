# :material-replay: Quick Resume

!!! info "Sleep modes on low-powered handhelds are often inefficient"

    Most KNULLI-driven devices are low-powered handhelds with very inefficient suspend modes. Unlike modern smartphones and computers, the KNULLI-compatible handheld devices usually consume **a lot** of battery power just to keep the memory alive. We strongly recommend **not** to rely on sleep modes for a long period of time. Instead, **shut the device down gracefully**. The **quick resume mode** will let you return to your game right after reboot.


If you shut the device down gracefully while you are playing (e.g., by holding the power button for two seconds), KNULLI can automatically save your progress (if the current emulator supports auto-save). Additionally, KNULLI can memorize which game you played last and launch it automatically when you turn the device back on. If auto save/load is enabled, KNULLI will even load the auto-save slot so that you can pick up your game right where you left, even after shutting the device down completely.

To enable quick resume mode,

* press ++"Start"++ to bring up the main menu
* go to *Game Settings*
* enable *Auto Save/Load*
* enable *Quick Resume Mode*

!!! warning "Not every emulator/system supports auto save/load"

    Be aware that standalone games (e.g., ports) and several emulators do not have any auto-save capabilities. Those games will **still be reloaded** after boot when quick resume mode is turned on. However, you will need to take care of saving and loading yourself!
