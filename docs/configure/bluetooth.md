# :material-bluetooth: Bluetooth

KNULLI supports a lot of different types of Bluetooth devices, such as input devices (controllers, mice, keyboards, etc.) and audio speakers and headphones.

## Pair a Bluetooth device

!!! info "Troubleshooting"

    If your KNULLI device fails to pair with one of your Bluetooth devices, try **disabling Wi-Fi** while **pairing**. (You can enable Wi-Fi again after pairing.)

    Also, please be aware that some Bluetooth controllers might be built to **only** support the system they are made for, e.g., Android or Nintendo Switch. If your Bluetooth controller does not work with your KNULLI device, make sure that it supports Bluetooth for **PC**.

To pair a Bluetooth device with your KNULLI device, you first need to make sure that both devices support Bluetooth. If so,

* press ++"Start"++ to bring up the main menu
* go to *Controller & Bluetooth Settings*
* *Enable Bluetooth* if it is not enabled, yet

Once Bluetooth is enabled,

* either try *Pair Bluetooth Pads Automatically* (to automatically pair input-devices in pairing mode)
* or select *Pair A Bluetooth Device Manually* and find your device in a list of available Bluetooth devices in your vicinity.

If your Bluetooth device does not show up or pairing does not work as expected, check the manual of your Bluetooth device for pairing instructions.

!!! info "Controllers are assigned to players automatically"

    As soon as Bluetooth controller is connected, it is automatically assigned to the next available player. Learn more about the automatic assignment in the [Controls](../controls) section.

## Connect/disconnect a paired Bluetooth device

Some devices, like controllers, connect automatically as soon as you turn them on. However, some devices require that you manually establish a connection from your KNULLI device. To establish a connection with an already paired device,

* press ++"Start"++ to bring up the main menu
* go to *Controller & Bluetooth Settings*
* go to *Bluetooth device list*
* pick the device you want to connect to and select *Connect* (or *Disconnect*)

## Forget a Bluetooth device

If you want to remove or "forget" a paired Bluetooth device,

* press the ++"Start"++ button to bring up the main menu
* head to *Controller & Bluetooth Settings*
* open *Forget A Bluetooth Device*
* find the device and remove it.
