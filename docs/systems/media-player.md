# :material-multimedia: MPV Media Player

Tiny handhelds aren't exactly made to watch movies on. However, in case you want to use your gaming device as a portable cinema or stereo, KNULLI comes with MPV, a built-in media player.

To play media with MPV,

- simply drop the media files in `roms/mpv` which you will find in your  [`userdata` folder](../../play/add-games/game-storage)
- a new category "MPV" will appear on your home screen
- find the media file you want to play and launch it like you would launch a game
