# Supported Devices

!!! info "You might be lucky!"
    We try very hard to keep the wiki up-to date, especially when it comes to supported devices. However, there might be supported devices that haven't made it on the list below. To find out if KNULLI is already available for your device, visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/knulli-cfw/distribution/releases/latest). You will find a list of all currently supported devices in the `Installation Package Downloads` section. If you find a package for your device there, you should follow the [Installation guide](../../play/install) to install KNULLI on your device. If your device is **not** listed there, please be patient. There is no public release available, yet. Do *not* attempt to install a package for a different device - it will not work.
