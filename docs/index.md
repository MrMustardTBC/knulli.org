# Welcome to KNULLI :material-gamepad:

## It's time for a sequel! [![Latest](https://img.shields.io/github/release/knulli-cfw/distribution.svg?labelColor=111111&color=5998FF&label=Latest&style=flat#only-light)](https://github.com/knulli-cfw/distribution/releases/latest)[![Latest](https://img.shields.io/github/release/knulli-cfw/distribution.svg?labelColor=dddddd&color=5998FF&label=Latest&style=flat#only-dark)](https://github.com/knulli-cfw/distribution/releases/latest)

*"Is this how Rome treats its heroes?"*

Oh yes, it is! KNULLI Gladiator was *so* good, it was bound to get a sequel. Hence, we are proud to announce that **KNULLI Gladiator II** has just gone public!

The new version is an update of KNULLI Gladiator, using still the same emulator versions etc. However, the new version comes with a couple of bugfixes and quality-of-life improvements. Most prominently, with Gladiator II, we finally introduce **OTA (over the air) updates** which will enable you to install future updates directly on-device!

We can't make any promises, obviously, but unless we make any **huge** changes which would require a reflash, you will be able to install **all future** KNULLI updates via OTA. (This will **not** shorten development cycles though! Expect OTA updates about every 3-4 month or so on the **stable** update channel.)

You will find a complete list of all new features, fixes, and changes in the [change log](https://github.com/knulli-cfw/distribution/blob/knulli-main/knulli-Changelog.md). However, here are some highlights:

### New features of KNULLI Gladiator II

- Added **device support** for Anbernic RG34XX SP, RG35XX Pro and Powkiddy V90S, V20
- **[Over-the-air updates](play/update)** via the *Updates & Downloads* menu will make future updates considerably more easy
- **SMB (SAMBA)** is now a [**service** you can turn on/off](play/add-games/network-transfer) which is **disabled** by default
- Added a toggle for always [auto-assigning](configure/controls) the **built-in controls** to player one and fixed issues with **USB controller assignment**
- Fixed issues with **standalone Dreamcast/PSP emulators** on **A133** devices (TrimUI Brick, TrimUI Smart Pro)
- Bezel decorations
    - are now **enabled automatically** when *Decoration Set* is set to *Auto*
    - are now supported for **standalone** emulators on **H700** devices (Anbernic RG XX series)
    - now come with a set *Default-Knulli-SP* specifically for **GBA** to give **SP** vibes on 4:3 clamshell displays
- A **Disk Check** utility to verify your SD card's integrity was added to *System Settings* â†’ *Frontend Developer Options*
- **Soft reset** [hotkey shortcut](play/hotkey-shortcuts) can be used to force EmulationStation to restart
- **[Factory reset](configure/reset-to-factory-settings)** is now possible on-device via EmulationStation
- A ton of **bugfixes** and **improvements** to system stability, performance, and battery life

!!! warning "Major Update"

    This version of KNULLI comes with a lot of new features which **require to re-flash the firmware**. Specifically, we need to **increase partition size** of the `BATOCERA` drive to accommodate OTA updates in the future.
    
    If you **update** from **Gladiator** to **Gladiator II**, you may keep your `system` folder and adopt all your previous settings, there will not be any compatibility issues between those two versions.
    
    For everyone else, we **strongly recommend** to simply start over with a clean install. However, if you want to try migrating your user data from a previous installation to the new installation, please have a look at the [Major Updates guide](guides/major-updates).

If you are **new to KNULLI** and want to get started: Head to the [Quick Start Guide](play/quick-start) on our website - it will guide you through the installation and your very first steps.

In any case: We hope you enjoy playing your games with KNULLI!

## About KNULLI

KNULLI is a custom firmware for retro gaming devices (handhelds, bartops, etc.). It's developed as a fork of [Batocera](https://batocera.org). It tries to provide support for devices that fall under at least one of these categories:

* There are no open-source kernel and/or u-boot sources available
* There are sources, but the kernel is either not mainline, and/or too old (e.g. devices with a BSP kernel 3.4 like the Egret II Mini)
* There is no GPU support or the GPU is not supported, so framebuffer is the only option
* It's a device that we own and have decided to build a CFW for it

## Features

KNULLI supports devices with GPU (GLES support) and framebuffer only (legacy).

* Emulation Station frontend for GPU based devices
* Simplemenu/Simplermenu+ for framebuffer only devices (also for GPU ones if preferred)
* RetroArch plus multiple libretro cores
* Wireless and Bluetooth support (including audio) when supported by the device
* Support for external USB wireless for those without internal wireless card
* Retroachievments
* Netplay
* Cover art/thumbnail scraper support
