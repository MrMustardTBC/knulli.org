    <p>The Media Transfer Protocol(MTP), connecting your device to a PC via USB cable, that was introduced in the Gladiator release is causing transferred files to be corrupted. At this time we recommended you <b>do not use MTP</b>, and instead either use <a href="https://knulli.org/play/add-games/network-transfer/#network-transfer">Network Transfer</a> or <a href="https://knulli.org/play/add-games/accessing-sd-card/#accessing-the-sd-card">connect your SD card to your PC</a>.</p>
