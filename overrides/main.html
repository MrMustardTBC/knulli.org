    <b style="font-size: 20px;">GitHub Download Issues</b>
    <p>We have received several reports by users who claim they cannot download builds from our official <a href="https://github.com/knulli-cfw/distribution/releases">GitHub repository</a>. Unfortunately, there is <b>nothing we can do</b> about this situation. This is between GitHub and you.</p>
    <p>As an alternative, you might want to try <b><a href="https://knulli.org/_inc/downloads/Knulli_Gladiator_II_20250813.torrent">the official torrent file</a></b> which enables you to download KNULLI via <b>BitTorrent</b>.</p>
